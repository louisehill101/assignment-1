<h1 style="color: Black;">Personal information</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:100%;">
<p style="color:black;">My name is Louise, I study IT at RMIT after moving from Canberra in
March. I absolutely love Melbourne (especially the food here). I was born
in Cambodia but spent majority of my childhood in Canberra/Sydney
and visiting home every year. I have studied a year of Finance at the
university of Canberra but decided Tech suited me more. My favourite
pastime would be Fashion; sewing and making clothes, but especially
the up and coming trend of digital fashion.</p>

<h1 style="color: black;">Interest in IT</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:100%;">
<p style="color: Black;">STEM in general has always sparked my interest. When i started to design my own clothes i was using 
Different softwares/tools. This inspired me to get involved in the world of technology as my hobbies 
Involved a lot of tech. Not only that but IT has such a vast number of specialisations and is vital in 
numerous amounts of jobs. The possibilities are endless which is one of the main reasons it 
interested me. Not only that but there is a whole world related to IT, which is interesting because you 
learn something new all the time.

In 2020 when the first lockdown happened I had a lot of time on my hands to start a new hobby. I 
Watched a fashion show that was completely digital, this was the first i have seen of that kind. This
Sparked my interest in IT. I was always Interested in coding and finally had time to start, I immediately
 loved it. Coding was very interesting to me because it was like a puzzle. I could write commands for
 my computer which I thought was Intriguing. I wanted to get into a field where the possibilities are 
endless. There will always be a need for tech and It will forever be evolving. 

I chose RMIT because it had an appealing campus, I enjoyed the facilities and the course structure 
of this degree. Many great People are RMIT alumni and I would love to be one of them. Not only that
But there is a strong focus on job prospects after your degree which I find not many universities 
have.

In this degree i would love to learn how to do more complex coding, AI, making a website and cyber 
Security. I would also love to learn aspects of IT that I never knew existed before. I expect to be fully 
Immersed in the IT world by the time i graduate.</p>

<h1 style="color: Black;">Ideal job - Web developer</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
 <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53400250?type=standout#searchRequestToken=c6f2460f-89fe-4576-be85-60c3c0d0f799t">Visit seek.com </a>
<p style="color:Black;">A full stack web developer designs and develops websites for businesses and individuals. They work
Both with the back end coding and front end presentation. This is appealing to me because i would 
Love to work closely with people and build websites. 

For this position a degree or qualification in IT, strong skills in CSS, HTTPS, Java and experience 
As a creative or web developer is vital. But most importantly, good people skills. As you are working 
In close proximity to people. Gaining trust and being a pleasure to work with will benefit me 
The most.

Currently I have some experience in the creative industry and basic coding knowledge. I have worked
In the industry and networked with creatives for over a year now and feel as though i have a good 
grasp of what’s desirable and what is not. Of course there a niches that i am still open to getting 
knowledge on (for instance the music industry).

By doing a degree in IT I will obtain the skills to create and design websites. This degree will also 
teach me how to fit into the job, what to expect and how to expand my knowledge. During the period
I am studying I plan to network with a lot of creatives/it specialist to ensure i know what to expect 
And how to grow in this industry.</p>

<h1 style="color: Black;">Results of tests</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
<p style="color:Black;">For the Myers-Briggs test the result was ENJT.</p>
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">Visit 16personalities.com</a>
<p style="color:Black;">For the learning style test it was found that i am a visual learner.</p>
 <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">visit educationplanner.com</a> 
 <p style="color:Black;">For the personality perfect test; ENFJ.</p>
 <a href="https://www.personalityperfect.com/test/free-personality-test/">visit personalityperfect.com</a> 
 

<h1 style="color: Black;">What does this mean to me?</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
<p style="color:Black;">These tests determine your personality. The myers briggs test determines how you perceive the 
world,How you feel about social interactions, how you process things and how you work through 
problems.This test Showed that i am an ENTJ(Extraversion (E), Intuition (N), Thinking (T), 
Judgment (J)), this means i am extroverted so I feel empowered by social interactions, I follow my 
intuition which meansI make decisions based on how i feel rather than using facts. With the learning 
the style test showed that I was a visual learner. This means i like to be shown how to to something or 
I need pictures/tutorials in order to learn. The perfect personality test was very similar to the Myers-Briggs test. It showed that i was a ENFJ. Extroverted (E), Intuitive (I), Feeling (F) and Thinking (T) these results are almost identical to the Myers-Briggs test. Which means i have a good grasp on what my personality is. 
 
According to the Myers Briggs test, ENTJ are good leaders with the ability to be controlling. I think
this may Interfere with how cohesive the team works. But as long as there is mutual respect and 
communication there shouldn't be a problem.  

I aim to form a team with multiple types of people. So we can all learn together, make sure to have
a strong understanding of the roles everyone is assigned to. Most importantly communicate the issues 
We have and are open minded to changing ideas.

I am passionate about being creative, for innovation I would like to see IT used in a different way to work with businesses and organisations to increase productivity and creativity. Creating different formats for websites, talking to other IT specialists and creatives to see how they would improve these formats would dramatically improve my knowledge and experience. Most importantly being open to constructive criticism.

<h1 style="color: Black;">Project ideas</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
 <h1 style="color: Black;">Overview</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
<p style="color:Black;">Everyday people have to use websites; either for information, shopping and leisure. Naturally
There will always be questions on how the website works, or for assistance. For my programming 
project i will be creating a software that involves speech-to-text, and text-to-speech software. 
This software will be used for e-commerce, profiles, science and economics.This will come into 
effect when users have queries or use FAQ’s.</p>
                       <h1 style="color: Black;">Motivation</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
                           <p style="color:Black;">For every business, it is important to stand out. To get customers to be interested and inspired 
By a business it is essential that they deliver a unique and positive experience. This software 
Allows customers and users to see that there is a huge focus on the experience, showing that they
Care about the customers. According to a study by speechmatics, 33% of companies stated that
Speech-to-text software improved customer experience. Another benefit is that it reduces cost.
It is always a priority to make things budget friendly. A statistic from speechmatics 
Stated that 42% of respondents were inclined to implement this technology for that reason alone.
                                                  (speech matics, 2019).</p>
                                                  <h1 style="color: Black;">Description</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
                           <p style="color:Black;"> The key features of this software formerly called dictation software, uses speech recognition in order to 
Create texts. This is available for many different languages (English, Mandarin, French and many others).
Users usually have a command on their device that initiates the software. For instance on Windows the 
User needs to press the Windows logo key + H, and for mac the steps are Apple menu > System 
Preferences, click Keyboard, then click Dictation. Click the pop-up menu below the microphone icon, 
then choose the microphone you want to use for keyboard dictation. Then there will be an automated
Voice saying something along the lines of “How can i help you today?”. There are some variations 
that allows you to put in your name so the software says “how can i help you Louise”. Some examples
Of these being used today are; Siri, Alexa and Cortana. People commonly use this software as an 
AI assistant, giving Alexa commands for her to do to save time. These assistants have the capability
To organise meetings, send texts, get direction, make phone calls and find places to eat. A great 
Feature about dictation is that it is accessible for people with a disability. It also works the other way 
Around. For instance, text-to-speech. If there is a word that has a difficult pronunciation, or if a user
Is trying to learn a new language online, they can click an icon that voices the word or sentence. This 
Icon is usually a microphone. Dictation software has been very popular in recent years as there are More people having to use their devices (COVID). This can shorten the time to write an essay or 
Email by half. When using this feature, it is important to use punctuation. For instance; say “comma”,
“Period”, “question mark” because the software isnt smart enough on its own to detect it. When the 
Speech is unclear the reply will be something along the lines of “i didn't get that” or “i'm sorry i can't 
 Help you”. On desktops the software works faster as opposed to mobile device. As of right now they
Can only listen for 30 seconds before making mistakes. They can transcribe over 200 words per min.
For context doctors can type 30 words per minute, It can also beat the touch typing record of 260
 wpm. This is the most attractive feature of this software. It has become so common that is 
Usually built into devices now. There still is a lot to improve on, for instance it can be faster, intake 
More words, and involve more languages. However it is shown to be a staple in most companies like
Apple, microsoft, amazon and Tesla. The software is reliable and makes life easier for users which is
                                                  Why it is such a great tool to implement into websites.</p>
                                                   <h1 style="color: Black;">Tools and technologies</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
                            <p style="color:Black;">In order to create your own dictation software there are things to consider. It is actually very difficult 
Because of the following reasons; the spoken language is complex, people don’t always speak coherently,
No two people speak the same and there is background noise. There are four main methods that have 
Been used. They are; audio pattern matching, pattern and feature analysis, statistical analysis and 
Modelling and artificial neural networks. Audio pattern matching is the most common and simple ways to
Create voice to text. Using a spectrogram. This is a three dimensional graph with the y-axis being frequency
And the x-axis being time. Each word has its own spectrogram, It recognises the word by comparing it to
A spectrogram. This method is limited because it only hase a finite number of words. An extension of the 
First method is feature analysis. As the first method is inefficient for all words, this method looks at the 
Building blocks of words. Statistical analysis uses maths to check the words and find patterns. For this 
Method you will need to have software to access statistical models containing this data. Artificial neural 
Networks aim to use a more AI approach by making the computer act like a human brain. The tools are 
                                                   Available through open source libraries. For instance CMU sphinx, KALDI and HTK.</p>
                                                    <h1 style="color: Black;">Skills Required</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
                           <p style="color:Black;">For CMU sphinx, it uses Java. However there are bindings for python and C++.There is a tutorial on Github 
Called “the Jasper project”. For KALDI it only uses C++ and for HTK (Hidden Markov Model toolkit) it is 
Owned by microsoft and uses C programming language. In order to do this project you must have a 
Strong background in either C++, Python, Java or C. Thankfully there are plenty of tutorials online that 
                                                  Teach you how to write in these languages.</p>
                                                  <h1 style="color: Black;">Outcome</h1>
<h1 style="Font-size:130%;">
                           <p style="color:Black;">Successful completion of this project would result a new and improved speech-to-text software. This will
Be versatile enough to be used for many different websites. This will improve efficiency and make a 
Positive impact on customer experience. This will impact anyone who wants to design their own websites.
The experience and coding knowledge of  me and the other members will grow, which in turn will benefit 
Us in the future. Even if the project is a failure, the experience is worth it. This innovation will change the 
Way websites operate.</p>
